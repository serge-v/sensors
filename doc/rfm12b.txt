Band FSK Transceiver

DESCRIPTION
===========

Hoperf’ RFM12B is a single chip, low power, multi-channel FSK
transceiver designed for use in applications requiring FCC or ETSI
conformance for unlicensed use in the 433, 868 and 915 MHz bands.
The RFM12B transceiver is a part of Hoperf’ EZRadioTM
product line,
which produces a flexible, low cost, and highly integrated solution that
does not require production alignments. The chip is a complete
analog RF and baseband transceiver including a multi-band PLL
synthesizer with PA, LNA, I/Q down converter mixers, baseband filters
and amplifiers, and an I/Q demodulator. All required RF functions are
integrated. Only an external crystal and bypass filtering are needed for
operation.

The RFM12B features a completely integrated PLL for easy RF
design, and its rapid settling time allows for fast frequency-hopping,
bypassing multipath fading and interference to achieve robust wireless
links. The PLL’s high resolution allows the usage of multiple channels
in any of the bands. The receiver baseband bandwidth (BW) is
programmable to accommodate various deviation, data rate and
crystal tolerance requirements. The transceiver employs the Zero-IF
approach with I/Q demodulation. Consequently, no external
components (except crystal and decoupling) are needed in most
applications.

The RFM12B dramatically reduces the load on the microcontroller with
the integrated digital data processing features: data filtering, clock
recovery, data pattern recognition, integrated FIFO and TX data
register. The automatic frequency control (AFC) feature allows the use
of a low accuracy (low cost) crystal. To minimize the system cost, the
RFM12B can provide a clock signal for the microcontroller, avoiding
the need for two crystals.

For low power applications, the RFM12B supports low duty cycle
operation based on the internal wake-up timer.

DETAILED FEATURE-LEVEL DESCRIPTION
==================================

The RFM12B FSK transceiver is designed to cover the
unlicensed frequency bands at 433, 868 and 915 MHz. The
device facilitates compliance with FCC and ETSI requirements.
The receiver block employs the Zero-IF approach with I/Q
demodulation, allowing the use of a minimal number of external
components in a typical application. The RFM12B incorporates
a fully integrated multi-band PLL synthesizer, PA with
antenna tuning, an LNA with switchable gain, I/Q down
converter mixers, baseband filters and amplifiers, and an I/Q
demodulator followed by a data filter.

PLL
===

The programmable PLL synthesizer determines the operating
frequency, while preserving accuracy based on the on-chip crystal-
controlled reference oscillator. The PLL’s high resolution allows the
usage of multiple channels in any of the bands.
RF Power Amplifier (PA)
The power amplifier has an open-collector differential output and
can directly drive different PCB antennas with a programmable
output power level. An automatic antenna tuning circuit is built in
to avoid costly trimming procedures and the so-called “hand
effect”.

LNA
===

The LNA has approximately 250 Ohm input impedance, which
functions well with the proposed antennas
If the RF input of the chip is connected to 50 Ohm devices, an
external matching circuit is required to provide the correct
matching and to minimize the noise figure of the receiver.
The LNA gain can be selected in four steps (between 0 and
-20dB relative to the highest gain) according to RF signal
strength. It can be useful in an environment with strong
interferers.

Baseband Filters
================

The receiver bandwidth is selectable by programming the
bandwidth (BW) of the baseband filters. This allows setting up
the receiver according to the characteristics of the signal to be
received.
An appropriate bandwidth can be chosen to accommodate
various FSK deviation, data rate and crystal tolerance
requirements. The filter structure is 7th order Butterworth low-
pass with 40 dB suppression at 2 · BW frequency. Offset
cancellation is done by using a high-pass filter with a cut-off
frequency below 7 kHz.
Full Baseband Amplifier Transfer Function
BW=67kHz

Data Filtering and Clock Recovery
=================================

Output data filtering can be completed by an external capacitor
or by using digital filtering according to the final application.
Analog operation: The filter is an RC type low-pass filter followed
by a Schmitt-trigger (St). The resistor (10 kOhm) and the St are
integrated on the chip. An (external) capacitor can be chosen
according to the actual bit rate. In this mode, the receiver can
handle up to 256 kbps data rate. The FIFO cannot be used in this
mode and clock is not provided for the demodulated data.
Digital operation: A digital filter is used with a clock frequency at
29 times the bit rate. In this mode, there is a clock recovery
circuit (CR), which can provide synchronized clock to the data.
Using this clock the received data can fill a FIFO. The CR has
three operation modes: fast, slow, and automatic. In slow mode,
its noise immunity is very high, but it has slower settling time and
requires more accurate data timing than in fast mode. In
automatic mode, the CR automatically changes between fast and
slow mode. The CR starts in fast mode, then after locking, it
automatically switches to slow mode
(Only the digital data filter and the clock recovery use the bit rate
clock. For analog operation, there is no need for setting the
correct bit rate.)

Data Validity Blocks

RSSI
====

A digital RSSI output is provided to monitor the input signal level.
It goes high if the received signal strength exceeds a given
preprogrammed level. An analog RSSI signal is also available.
The RSSI settling time depends on the external filter capacitor.
Pin 15 is used as analog RSSI output. The digital RSSI can be
monitored by reading the status register.
Typical Analog ARSSI Voltage vs. RF Input Power

DQD
===

The operation of the Data Quality Detector is based on counting
the spikes on the unfiltered received data. High output signal
indicates an operating FSK transmitter within baseband filter
bandwidth from the local oscillator. DQD threshold parameter
can be set by using the Data Filter Command.

AFC
===

By using an integrated Automatic Frequency Control (AFC)
feature, the receiver can minimize the TX/RX offset in discrete
steps, allowing the use of:
• Narrower receiver bandwidth (i.e. increased
sensitivity)
• Higher data rate
• Inexpensive crystals
Crystal Oscillator
The RFM12B has a single-pin crystal oscillator circuit, which
provides a 10 MHz reference signal for the PLL. To reduce
external parts and simplify design, the crystal load capacitor is
internal and programmable. Guidelines for selecting the
appropriate crystal can be found later in this datasheet.
The transceiver can supply a clock signal for the microcontroller;
so accurate timing is possible without the need for a second
crystal.
When the microcontroller turns the crystal oscillator off by
clearing the appropriate bit using the Power Management
Command, the chip provides a fixed number (192) of further
clock pulses (“clock tail”) for the microcontroller to let it go to
idle or sleep mode. If this clock output is not used, it is
suggested to turn the output buffer off by the Power
Management Command.

Low Battery Voltage Detector
============================

The low battery detector circuit monitors the supply voltage and
generates an interrupt if it falls below a programmable threshold
level. The detector circuit has 50 mV hysteresis.
Wake-Up Timer
The wake-up timer has very low current consumption (1.5 µA
typical) and can be programmed from 1 ms to several days with
an accuracy of ±10%.
The wake-up timer calibrates itself to the crystal oscillator at
every startup. For proper calibration of the wake-up timer the
crystal oscillator must be running before the wake-up timer is
enabled. The calibration process takes approximately 0.5ms.
For the crystal start up time(tsx).

Event Handling
==============

In order to minimize current consumption, the transceiver
supports different power saving modes. Active mode can be
initiated by several wake-up events (negative logical pulse on
nINT input, wake-up timer timeout, low supply voltage detection,
on-chip FIFO filled up or receiving a request through the serial
interface).
If any wake-up event occurs, the wake-up logic generates an
interrupt signal, which can be used to wake up the
microcontroller, effectively reducing the period the
microcontroller has to be active. The source of the interrupt can
be read out from the transceiver by the microcontroller through
the SDO pin.

Interface and Controller
========================

An SPI compatible serial interface lets the user select the
frequency band, center frequency of the synthesizer, and the
bandwidth of the baseband signal path. Division ratio for the
microcontroller clock, wake-up timer period, and low supply
voltage detector threshold are also programmable. Any of these
auxiliary functions can be disabled when not needed. All
parameters are set to default after power-on; the programmed
values are retained during sleep mode. The interface supports
the read-out of a status register, providing detailed information
about the status of the transceiver and the received data.
The transmitter block is equipped with two 8-bit wide TX data
registers. It is possible to write 8 bits into the register in burst
mode and the internal bit rate generator transmits the bits out
with the predefined rate. For further details, see the TX Register
Buffered Data Transmission section.
It is also possible to store the received data bits into a FIFO
register and read them out in a buffered mode.

CONTROL INTERFACE
=================

Commands to the transmitter are sent serially. Data bits on pin SDI are shifted into the device upon the rising edge of the clock on
pin SCK whenever the chip select pin nSEL is low. When the nSEL signal is high, it initializes the serial interface. All commands
consist of a command code, followed by a varying number of parameter or data bits. All data are sent MSB first (e.g. bit 15 for a 16-
bit command). Bits having no influence (don’t care) are indicated with X. Special care must be taken when the microcontroller’s built-
in hardware serial port is used. If the port cannot be switched to 16-bit mode then a separate I/O line should be used to control the
nSEL pin to ensure the low level during the whole duration of the command or a software serial control interface should be
implemented. The Power-On Reset (POR) circuit sets default values in all control and command registers.
The receiver will generate an interrupt request (IT) for the microcontroller - by pulling the nIRQ pin low - on the following events:
• The TX register is ready to receive the next byte (RGIT)
• The RX FIFO has received the preprogrammed amount of bits (FFIT)
• Power-on reset (POR)
• RX FIFO overflow (FFOV) / TX register underrun (RGUR)
• Wake-up timer timeout (WKUP)
• Negative pulse on the interrupt input pin nINT (EXT)
• Supply voltage below the preprogrammed value is detected (LBD)
FFIT and FFOV are applicable when the RX FIFO is enabled. RGIT and RGUR are applicable only when the TX register is enabled. To
identify the source of the IT, the status bits should be read out.

     1  0  0  0  0  0 1 0 er ebb et es ex eb ew dc 8208h

Bit Function of the control bit Related blocks
er Enables the whole receiver chain RF front end, baseband, synthesizer, crystal oscillator
ebb The receiver baseband circuit can be separately switched on Baseband
et Switches on the PLL, the power amplifier, and starts the transmission (If TX register is enabled) Power amplifier, synthesizer, crystal oscillator
es Turns on the synthesizer Synthesizer
ex Turns on the crystal oscillator Crystal oscillator
eb Enables the low battery detector Low battery detector
ew Enables the wake-up timer Wake-up timer
dc Disables the clock output (pin 8) Clock output buffer
The ebb, es, and ex bits are provided to optimize the TX to RX or RX to TX turnaround time.
The RF frontend consist of the LNA (low noise amplifier) and the mixer. The synthesizer block has two main components: the VCO
and the PLL. The baseband section contains the baseband amplifier, low pass filter, limiter and the I/Q demodulator.
To decrease TX/RX turnaround time, it is possible to leave the baseband section powered on. Switching to RX mode means disabling
the PA and enabling the RF frontend. Since the baseband block is already on, the internal startup calibration will not be performed,
the turnaround time will be shorter.
The synthesizer also has an internal startup calibration procedure. If quick RX/TX switching needed it may worth to leave this block
on. Enabling the transmitter using the et bit will turn on the PA, the synthesizer is already up and running. The power amplifier almost
immediately produces TX signal at the output.
The crystal oscillator provides reference signal to the RF synthesizer, the baseband circuits and the digital signal processor part.
When the receiver or the transmitter part frequently used, it is advised to leave the oscillator running because the crystal might need
a few milliseconds to start. This time mainly depends on the crystal parameters.
It is important to note that leaving blocks unnecessary turned on can increase the current consumption thus decreasing the battery
life.

Note:

• If both et and er bits are set the chip goes to receive mode.
• FSK / nFFS input are equipped with internal pull-up resistor. To achieve minimum current consumption do not pull this input
to logic low in sleep mode.
• To enable the RF synthesizer, the crystal oscillator must be turned on
• To turn on the baseband circuits, the RF synthesizer (and this way the crystal oscillator) must be enabled.
• Setting the er bit automatically turns on the crystal oscillator, the synthesizer, the baseband circuits and the RF fronted.
• Setting the et bit automatically turns on the crystal oscillator, the synthesizer and the RF power amplifier.
Clock tail feature: When the clock output (pin 8) used to provide clock signal for the microcontroller (dc bit is set to 0), it is possible
to use the clock tail feature. This means that the crystal oscillator turn off is delayed, after issuing the command (clearing the ex bit)
192 more clock pulses are provided. This ensures that the microcontroller can switch itself to low power consumption mode. In order
to use this feature, a Status Read Command must be issued before the ex bit set to zero. If status read was not performed then the
clock output shuts down immediately leaving the microcontroller in unknown state.
Automatic crystal oscillator enable/disable feature: When an interrupt occurs, the crystal oscillator automatically turns on –
regardless to the setting of the ex bit – to supply clock signal to the microcontroller. After clearing all interrupts by handling them
properly (see the Interrupt Handling section) and performing Status Read Command, the crystal oscillator is automatically turned
off. The clock tail feature provides enough clock pulses for the microcontroller to go to low power mode. Due to this automatic
feature, it is not possible to turn off the crystal by clearing the ex bit if any interrupt is active. For example, after power on the POR
interrupt must be cleared by a status read then writing zero to the ex bit will put the part into sleep mode. Very important to clear all
interrupts before turning the ex bit off because the extra current required by running crystal oscillator can shorten the battery life
significantly.
Disabling the clock output (bit dc=1) turns off both the clock tail and the automatic crystal oscillator enable/disable feature, only the
ex bit controls the crystal oscillator (supposing that both the er and et bits are cleared), the interrupts have no effect on it.

1 0 1 0 f11 f10 f9 f8 f7 f6 f5 f4 f3 f2 f1 f0 A680h
The 12-bit parameter F (bits f11 to f0) should be in the range
of 96 and 3903. When F value sent is out of range, the
previous value is kept. The synthesizer center frequency f0
can be calculated as:
f0 = 10 · C1 · (C2 + F/4000) [MHz]
The constants C1 and C2 are determined by
the selected band as:
Band Minimum Frequency Maximum Frequency PLL Frequency Step
433 MHz 430.2400 MHz 439.7575 MHz 2.5 kHz

     1  1  0  0  0  1 1 0 cs r6 r5 r4 r3 r2 r1 r0 C623h

The actual bit rate in transmit mode and the expected bit rate of the received data stream in receive mode is determined by the 7-bit
parameter R (bits r6 to r0) and bit cs.
BR = 10000 / 29 / (R+1) / (1+cs · 7) [kbps]
In the receiver set R according to the next function:
R= (10000 / 29 / (1+cs · 7) / BR) – 1, where BR is the expected bit rate in kbps.
Apart from setting custom values, the standard bit rates from 600 bps to 115.2 kbps can be approximated with small error.
Data rate accuracy requirements:
Clock recovery in slow mode: ΔBR/BR < 1/(29 · Nbit) Clock recovery in fast mode: ΔBR/BR < 3/(29 · Nbit)
BR is the bit rate set in the receiver and ΔBR is the bit rate difference between the transmitter and the receiver. Nbit is the maximum
number of consecutive ones or zeros in the data stream. It is recommended for long data packets to include enough 1/0 and 0/1
transitions, and to be careful to use the same division ratio in the receiver and in the transmitter.

0: manual mode, the clock recovery mode is set by Bit 6 (ml)
Bit 6 (ml): Clock recovery lock control
1: fast mode, fast attack and fast release (4 to 8-bit preamble (1010...) is recommended)

1 Analog RC filter
Digital: This is a digital realization of an analog RC filter followed by a comparator with hysteresis. The time
constant is automatically adjusted to the bit rate defined by the Data Rate Command.
Note: Bit rate cannot exceed 115 kpbs in this mode.
Analog RC filter: The demodulator output is fed to pin 7 over a 10 kOhm resistor. The filter cut-off frequency is set
by the external capacitor connected to this pin and VSS.

Bits 2-0 (f2 to f0): DQD threshold parameter.
The Data Quality Detector is a digital processing part of the radio, connected to the demodulator - it is an indicator
reporting the reception of an FSK modulated RF signal. It will work every time the receiver is on. Setting this
parameter defines how clean incoming data stream would be stated as good data (valid FSK signal).
If the internally calculated data quality value exceeds the DQD threshold parameter for five consecutive data bits
for both the high and low periods, then the DQD signal goes high.
The DQD parameter in the Data Filter Command should be chosen according to the following rules:
The DQD parameter can be calculated with the following formula:
DQDpar = 4 x (deviation – TX-RXoffset) / bit rate
It should be larger than 4 because otherwise noise might be treated as a valid FSK signal
The maximum value is 7.

Note: The synchron pattern consists of one or two bytes depending on the sp bit. Byte1 is fixed 2Dh, Byte0 can be programmed by
the Synchron Pattern Command.
Bit 2 (al): Set the input of the FIFO fill start condition:

dr Reset mode Reset triggered when
0 Sensitive reset Vdd below 1.6V, Vdd glitch greater than 600mV
1 Non-sensitive reset Vdd below 250mV
Note: To restart the synchron pattern recognition, bit 1 (ef, FIFO fill enable) should be cleared and set.

The Byte0 of the synchron pattern (see FIFO and Reset Mode command) can be reprogrammed by B <b7:b0>.

9. Receiver FIFO Read Command
=============================

Bit 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 POR
     1  0  1  1  0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 B000h
With this command, the controller can read 8 bits from the receiver FIFO. Bit 6 (ef) must be set in Configuration Setting Command
.
Note: During FIFO access fSCK cannot be higher than fref /4, where fref is the crystal oscillator frequency. When the duty-cycle of the
clock signal is not 50 % the shorter period of the clock pulse width should be at least 2/fref.

10. AFC Command

a1 a0 Operation mode
0 0 Auto mode off (Strobe is controlled by microcontroller)
0 1 Runs only once after each power-up
1 0 Keep the foffset only during receiving (VDI=high)
1 1 Keep the foffset value independently from the state of the VDI signal
RFM12B
22
rl1 rl0 Max deviation
0 0 No restriction
0 1 +15 fres to -16 fres
1 0 +7 fres to -8 fres
1 1 +3 fres to -4 fres
Bit 5-4 (rl1 to rl0): Range limit. Limits the value of the frequency offset register to the next values:
fres:
433 MHz bands: 2.5 kHz
868 MHz band: 5 kHz
915 MHz band: 7.5 kHz
Bit 3 (st): Strobe edge, when st goes to high, the actual latest calculated frequency error is stored into the offset register of
the AFC block.
Bit 2 (fi): Switches the circuit to high accuracy (fine) mode. In this case, the processing time is about twice as long, but the
measurement uncertainty is about half.
Bit 1 (oe): Enables the frequency offset register. It allows the addition of the offset register to the frequency control word of
the PLL.
Bit 0 (en): Enables the calculation of the offset frequency by the AFC circuit.
In manual mode, the strobe signal is provided by the microcontroller. One measurement cycle (and strobe) signal can compensate
about 50-60% of the actual frequency offset. Two measurement cycles can compensate 80%, and three measurement cycles can
compensate 92%. The ATGL bit in the status register can be used to determine when the actual measurement cycle is finished.
In automatic operation mode (no strobe signal is needed from the microcontroller to update the output offset register) the AFC circuit
is automatically enabled when the VDI indicates potential incoming signal during the whole measurement cycle and the circuit
measures the same result in two subsequent cycles.
Without AFC the transmitter and the receiver needs to be tuned precisely to the same frequency. RX/TX frequency offset can lower
the range. The units must be adjusted carefully during production, stable, expensive crystal must be used to avoid drift or the output
power needs to be increased to compensate yield loss.
The AFC block will calculate the TX-RX offset. This value will be used to pull the RX synthesizer close to the frequency of the
transmitter. The main benefits of the automatic frequency control: cheap crystal can be used, the temperature or aging drift will not
cause range loss and no production alignment needed.

p2 p1 p0 Relative Output Power [dB]

0 1 1 -7.5
1 0 0 -10
1 0 1 -12.5
1 1 0 -15
1 1 1 -17.5
There are four operation modes:
1. (a1=0, a0=0) Automatic operation of the AFC is off. Strobe bit can be controlled by the microcontroller.
2. (a1=0, a0=1) The circuit measures the frequency offset only once after power up. This way, extended TX-RX distance can be
achieved. In the final application, when the user inserts the battery, the circuit measures and compensates for the frequency offset
caused by the crystal tolerances. This method allows for the use of cheaper quartz in the application and provides protection against
tracking an interferer.
3. (a1=1, a0=0) The frequency offset is calculated automatically and the center frequency is corrected when the VDI is high. The
calculated value is dropped when the VDI goes low. To improvethe efficiency of the AFC calculation two methods are recommended:
a. The transmit package should start with a low effective baud rate pattern (i.e.: 00110011) because it is easier to receive. The
circuit automatically measures the frequency offset during this initial pattern and changes the receiving frequency accordingly.
The further part of the package will be received by the corrected frequency settings.
b. The transmitter sends the first part of the packet with a step higher deviation than required during normal operation to ease
the receiving. After the frequency shift was corrected, the deviation can be reduced.
In both cases (3a and 3b), when the VDI indicates poor receiving conditions (VDI goes low), the output register is automatically
cleared. Use this “drop offset” mode when the receiver communicates with more than one transmitter.
4. (a1=1, a0=1) It is similar to mode 3, but suggested to use when a receiver operates with only one transmitter. After a complete
measuring cycle, the measured value is kept independently of the state of the VDI signal. When the receiver is paired with only one
transmitter, it is possible to use this “keep offset” mode. In this case, the DRSSI limit should be selected carefully to minimize the
range hysteresis.

Bits 6-5 (ob1-ob0): Microcontroller output clock buffer rise and fall time control. The ob1-ob0 bits are changing the output drive
current of the CLK pin. Higher current provides faster rise and fall times but can cause interference.
ob1 ob0 Selected µC CLK frequency

Note: Needed for optimization of the RF performance. Optimal settings can vary according to the external load capacitance.
Bit 3 (dly): Switches on the delay in the phase detector when this bit is set.
Bit 2 (ddit):When set, disables the dithering in the PLL loop.
Bit 0 (bw0): PLL bandwidth can be set for optimal TX RF performance.

1 1 1 r4 r3 r2 r1 r0 m7 m6 m5 m4 m3 m2 m1 m0 E196h
The wake-up timeperiod can be calculated by (m7 to m0) and (r4 to r0):
Twake-up = 1.03 · M · 2R + 0.5 [ms]
Note:
• For continual operation, the ew bit should be cleared and set at the end of every cycle.
• For future compatibility, use R in a range of 0 and 29.

15. Low Duty-Cycle Command
==========================

1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 d6 d5 d4 d3 d2 d1 d0 en C80Eh
With this command, autonomous low duty-cycle operation can be set in order to decrease the average power consumption in receive
mode.
Bits 7-1 (d6-d0): The duty-cycle can be calculated by using (d6 to d0) and M. (M is parameter in a Wake-Up Timer Command, see
above). The time cycle is determined by the Wake-Up Timer Command.
duty-cycle= (D · 2 +1) / M · 100%
Bit 0 (en): Enables the low duty-cycle Mode. Wake-up timer interrupt is not generated in this mode.
Note: In this operation mode, bit er must be cleared and bit ew must be set in the Power Management Command.
In low duty-cycle mode the receiver periodically wakes up for a short period of time and checks if there is a valid FSK transmission in
progress. FSK transmission is detected in the frequency range determined by Frequency Setting Command plus and minus the
baseband filter bandwidth determined by the Receiver Control Command. This on-time is automatically extended while DQD
indicates good received signal condition.
When calculating the on-time take into account:
- the crystal oscillator, the synthesizer and the PLL needs time to start, see the AC Characteristics (Turn-on/Turnaround
timings)
- depending on the DQD parameter, the chip needs to receive a few valid data bits before the DQD signal indicates good
signal condition (Data Filter Command)
Choosing too short on-time can prevent the crystal oscillator from starting or the DQD signal will not go high even when the received
signal has good quality.
There is an application proposal. The RFM12B is configured to work in FIFO mode. The chip periodically wakes up and switches to
receiving mode. If valid FSK data received, the chip sends an interrupt to the microcontroller and continues filling the RX FIFO. After
the transmission is over and the FIFO is read out completely and all other interrupts are cleared, the chip goes back to low power
consumption mode.

The read command starts with a zero, whereas all other control commands start with a one. If a read command is identified, the
status bits will be clocked out on the SDO pin as follows:
Status Register Read Sequence with FIFO Read Example:
Bit Name Function
RGIT TX register is ready to receive the next byte (Can be cleared by Transmitter Register Write Command)
FFIT
The number of data bits in the RX FIFO has reached the pre-programmed limit (Can be cleared by any of the
FIFO read methods)
POR Power-on reset (Cleared after Status Read Command)
RGUR TX register under run, register over write (Cleared after Status Read Command)
FFOV RX FIFO overflow (Cleared after Status Read Command)
WKUP Wake-up timer overflow (Cleared after Status Read Command)
EXT Logic level on interrupt pin (pin 16) changed to low (Cleared after Status Read Command)
LBD Low battery detect, the power supply voltage is below the pre-programmed limit
FFEM FIFO is empty
ATS Antenna tuning circuit detected strong enough RF signal
RSSI The strength of the incoming signal is above the pre-programmed limit
DQD Data quality detector output
CRL Clock recovery locked
ATGL Toggling in each AFC cycle
OFFS(6) MSB of the measured frequency offset (sign of the offset value)
OFFS(3) -OFFS(0) Offset value to be added to the value of the frequency control parameter (Four LSB bits)
Note: In order to get accurate values the AFC has to be disabled during the read by clearing the en bit in the AFC Control Command.
The AFC offset value (OFFS bits in the status word) is represented as a two’s complement number. The actual frequency
offset can be calculated as the AFC offset value multiplied by the current PLL frequency step (see the Frequency Setting
Command).

INTERRUPT HANDLING
==================

In order to achieve low power consumption there is an advanced event handling circuit implemented. The device has a very low
power consumption mode, so called sleep mode. In this mode only a few parts of the circuit are working. In case of an event, the
device wakes up, switches into active mode and an interrupt signal generated on the nIRQ pin to indicate the changed state to the
microcontroller. The cause of the interrupt can be determined by reading the status word of the device (see Status Read Command).

Several interrupt sources are available:

• RGIT – TX register empty interrupt: This interrupt generated when the transmit register is empty. Valid only when the el
(enable internal data register) bit is set in the Configuration Setting Command, and the transmitter is enabled in the Power
Management command.

• FFIT – the number of bits in the RX FIFO reached the preprogrammed level: When the number of received data bits in the
receiver FIFO reaches the threshold set by the f3…f0 bits of the FIFO and Reset Mode Command an interrupt is fired.
Valid only when the ef (enable FIFO mode) bit is set in the Configuration Setting Command and the receiver is enabled in the
Power Management Command.

• POR – power on reset interrupt: An interrupt generated when the change on the VDD line triggered the internal reset circuit or
a software reset command was issued. For more details, see the Reset Modes section.

• RGUR – TX register under run: The automatic baud rate generator finished the transmission of the byte in the TX register
before the register write occurred. Valid only when the el (enable internal data register) bit is set in the Configuration Setting
Command and the transmitter is enabled in the Power Management command.

• FFOV – FIFO overflow: There are more bits received than the capacity of the FIFO (16 bits). Valid only when the ef (enable
FIFO mode) bit is set in the Configuration Setting Command and the receiver is enabled in the Power Management
command

• WKUP – wake-up timer interrupt: This interrupt event occurs when the time specified by the Wake-Up Timer Command has
elapsed. Valid only when the ew bit is set in the Power Management Command.
• EXT – external interrupt: Follows the level of the nINT pin if it is configured as an external Interrupt pin in the Receiver Control
Command.

• LBD – low battery detector interrupt: Occurs when the VDD goes below the programmable low battery detector threshold level
(v3…v0 bits in the Low Battery and Microcontroller Clock Divider Command). Valid only when the eb (enable low battery
detector) bit is set in the Power Management Command.
If any of the sources becomes active, the nIRQ pin will change to logic low level, and the corresponding bit in the status byte will be
HIGH.

Clearing an interrupt actually implies two things:
• Releasing the nIRQ pin to return to logic high
• Clearing the corresponding bit in the status byte
This may be completed with the following interrupt sources:
• RGIT: both the nIRQ pin and status bit remain active until the register is written (if under-run does not occur until the register
write), or the transmitter and the TX latch are switched off.
• FFIT: both the nIRQ pin and status bit remain active until the FIFO is read (a FIFO IT threshold number of bits have been
read), the receiver is switched off, or the RX FIFO is switched off.
• POR: both the nIRQ pin and status bit can be cleared by the read status command
• RGUR: this bit is always set together with RGIT; both the nIRQ pin and the status bit remain active until the transmitter and
the TX latch is switched off.
• FFOV: this bit is always set together with FFIT; it can be cleared by the status read command, but the FFIT bit and hence the
nIRQ pin will remain active until the FIFO is read fully, the receiver is switched off, or the RX FIFO is switched off.
• WKUP: both the nIRQ pin and status bit can be cleared by the read status command
• EXT: both the nIRQ pin and status bit follow the level of the nINT pin
• LBD: the nIRQ pin can be released by the reading the status, but the status bit will remain active while the VDD is below the
threshold.
RFM12B
29
The best practice in interrupt handling is to start with a status read when interrupt occurs, and then make a decision based on the
status byte. It is very important to mention that any interrupt can “wake-up” the EZradio chip from sleep mode. This means that the
crystal oscillator starts to supply clock signal to the microcontroller even if the microcontroller has its own clock source. Also, the
RFM12B will not go to low current sleep mode if any interrupt remains active regardless to the state of the ex (enable crystal
oscillator) bit in the Power Management Command. This way the microcontroller always can have clock signal to process the
interrupt. To prevent high current consumption and this way short battery life, it is strongly advised to process and clear every
interrupt before going to sleep mode. All unnecessary functions should be turned off to avoid unwanted interrupts. Before freezing
the microcontroller code, a thorough testing must be performed in order to make sure that all interrupt sources are handled before
putting the radio device to low power consumption sleep mode. If the dc bit is set in the Power Management Command, then only
the ex bit controls the crystal oscillator (supposing that both the er and et bits are cleared), the interrupts have no effect on it.

TX REGISTER BUFFERED DATA TRANSMISSION
======================================

In this operating mode (enabled by bit el, in the Configuration Setting Command) the TX data is clocked into one of the two
8-bit data registers. The transmitter starts to send out the data from the first register (with the given bit rate) when bit et is set with
the Power Management Command. The initial value of the data registers (AAh) can be used to generate preamble. During this
mode, the SDO pin can be monitored to check whether the register is ready (SDO is high) to receive the next byte from the
microcontroller.

Notes:
*Ttx_XTAL_ON is the start-up time of the PLL + PA with running crystal oscillator
** SDO is tri-state if nSEL is logic high.
Note: The content of the data registers are initialized by clearing bit et.
A complete transmit sequence should be performed as follows:
a. Enable the TX register by setting the el bit to 1 (Configuration Setting Command)
b. The TX register automatically filled out with 0xAAAA, which can be used to generate preamble.
c. Enable the transmitter by setting the et bit (Power Management Command)
d. The synthesizer and the PLL turns on, calibrates itself then the power amplifier automatically enabled
e. The TX data transmission starts
f. When the transmission of the byte completed, the nIRQ pin goes high, the SDO pin goes low at the same time. The nIRQ
pulse shows that the first 8 bits (the first byte, by default 0xAA) has transmitted. There are still 8 bits in the transmit
register.
g. The microcontroller recognizes the interrupt and writes a data byte to the TX register
h. Repeat f. - g. until the last data byte reached
i. Using the same method, transmit a dummy byte. The value of this dummy byte can be anything.
j. The next high to low transition on the nIRQ line (or low to high on the SDO pin) shows that the transmission of the data
bytes ended. The dummy byte is still in the TX latch.
k. Turn off the transmitter by setting the et bit to 0. This event will probably happen while the dummy byte is being
transmitted. Since the dummy byte contains no useful information, this corruption will cause no problems.
l. Clearing the el bit clears the Register Underrun interrupt; the nIRQ pin goes high, the SDO low.
It is possible to perform this sequence without sending a dummy byte (step i.) but after loading the last data byte to the transmit
register the PA turn off should be delayed for at least 16 bits time. The clock source of the microcontroller (if the clock is not supplied
by the RFM12B) should be stable enough over temperature and voltage to ensure this minimum delay under all
operating circumstances.
When the dummy byte is used, the whole process is driven by interrupts. Changing the TX data rate has no effect on the algorithm
and no accurate delay measurement is needed.

RX FIFO BUFFERED DATA READ
==========================

In this operating mode, incoming data are clocked into a 16-bit FIFO buffer. The receiver starts to fill up the FIFO when the Valid Data
Indicator (VDI) bit and the synchron pattern recognition circuit indicates potentially real incoming data. This prevents the FIFO from
being filled with noise and overloading the external microcontroller.
Interrupt Controlled Mode:
The user can define the FIFO IT level (the number of received bits) which will generate the nFFIT when exceeded. The status bits
report the changed FIFO status in this case.
Polling Mode:
When nFFS signal is low the FIFO output is connected directly to the SDO pin and its content can be clocked out by the SCK. Set the
FIFO IT level to 1. In this case, as long as FFIT indicates received bits in the FIFO, the controller may continue to take the bits away.
When FFIT goes low, no more bits need to be taken.
An SPI read command is also available to read out the content of the FIFO (Receiver FIFO Read Command).
FIFO Read Example with FFIT Polling

SCK

Note: During FIFO access fSCK cannot be higher than fref /4, where fref is the crystal oscillator frequency. When the duty-cycle of the
clock signal is not 50% the shorter period of the clock pulse should be at least 2/fref .

CRYSTAL SELECTION GUIDELINES
============================

The crystal oscillator of the RFM12B requires a 10 MHz parallel mode crystal. The circuit contains an integrated load capacitor
in order to minimize the external component count. The internal load capacitance value is programmable from 8.5 pF to 16 pF in
0.5 pF steps. With appropriate PCB layout, the total load capacitance value can be 10 pF to 20 pF so a variety of crystal types
can be used.
When the total load capacitance is not more than 20 pF and a worst case 7 pF shunt capacitance (C 0) value is expected for the
crystal, the oscillator is able to start up with any crystal having less than 100 ohms ESR (equivalent series loss resistance). However,
lower C0 and ESR values guarantee faster oscillator startup.
The crystal frequency is used as the reference of the PLL, which generates the local oscillator frequency (fLO ). Therefore, f LO is
directly proportional to the crystal frequency. The accuracy requirements for production tolerance, temperature drift and aging can
thus be determined from the maximum allowable local oscillator frequency error.
Whenever a low frequency error is essential for the application, it is possible to “pull” the crystal to the accurate frequency by
changing the load capacitor value. The widest pulling range can be achieved if the nominal required load capacitance of the crystal is
in the “midrange”, for example 16 pF. The “pull-ability” of the crystal is defined by its motional capacitance and C0.

RX-TX ALIGNMENT PROCEDURES
==========================

RX-TX frequency offset can be caused only by the differences in the actual reference frequency. To minimize these errors it is
suggested to use the same crystal type and the same PCB layout for the crystal placement on the RX and TX PCBs.
To verify the possible RX-TX offset it is suggested to measure the CLK output of both chips with a high level of accuracy. Do not
measure the output at the XTL pin since the measurement process itself will change the reference frequency. Since the carrier
frequencies are derived from the reference frequency, having identical reference frequencies and nominal frequency settings at the
TX and RX side there should be no offset if the CLK signals have identical frequencies.
It is possible to monitor the actual RX-TX offset using the AFC status report included in the status byte of the receiver. By reading out
the status byte from the receiver, the actual measured offset frequency will be reported. In order to get accurate values the AFC has
to be disabled during the read by clearing the en bit in the AFC Control Command.

RESET MODES
===========

The chip will enter into reset mode if any of the following conditions are met:
• Power-on reset: During a power up sequence until the Vdd has reached the correct level and stabilized
• Power glitch reset: Transients present on the Vdd line
• Software reset: Special control command received by the chip
Power-on reset
After power up the supply voltage starts to rise from 0V. The reset block has an internal ramping voltage reference (reset-ramp
signal), which is rising at 100mV/ms (typical) rate. The chip remains in reset state while the voltage difference between the actual
V dd and the internal reset-ramp signal is higher than the reset threshold voltage, which is 600 mV (typical). As long as the Vdd voltage
is less than 1.6V (typical) the chip stays in reset mode regardless the voltage difference between the Vdd and the internal ramp
signal.
The reset event can last up to 100ms supposing that the Vdd reaches 90% its final value within 1ms. During this period, the chip
does not accept control commands via the serial control interface.
Power-on reset example:
Power glitch reset
The internal reset block has two basic mode of operation: normal and sensitive reset. The default mode is sensitive, which can be
changed by the appropriate control command (see Related control commands at the end of this section). In normal mode the power
glitch detection circuit is disabled.
There can be spikes or glitches on the Vdd line if the supply filtering is not satisfactory or the internal resistance of the power supply
is too high. In such cases if the sensitive reset is enabled an (unwanted) reset will be generated if the positive going edge of the Vdd
has a rising rate greater than 100mV/ms and the voltage difference between the internal ramp signal and the Vdd reaches the reset
threshold voltage (600 mV). Typical case when the battery is weak and due to its increased internal resistance a sudden decrease of
the current consumption (for example turning off the power amplifier) might lead to an increase in supply voltage. If for some reason
the sensitive reset cannot be disabled step-by-step decrease of the current consumption (by turning off the different stages one by
one) can help to avoid this problem.
Any negative change in the supply voltage will not cause reset event unless the Vdd level reaches the reset threshold voltage (250mV
in normal mode, 1.6V in sensitive reset mode).
If the sensitive mode is disabled and the power supply turned off the Vdd must drop below 250mV in order to trigger a power-on reset
event when the supply voltage is turned back on. If the decoupling capacitors keep their charges for a long time it could happen that
no reset will be generated upon power-up because the power glitch detector circuit is disabled.
Note that the reset event reinitializes the internal registers, so the sensitive mode will be enabled again.

Software reset
Software reset can be issued by sending the appropriate control command (described at the end of the section) to the chip. The
result of the command is the same as if power-on reset was occurred but the length of the reset event is much less, 0.25ms typical.
The software reset works only when the sensitive reset mode is selected.
Vdd line filtering
During the reset event (caused by power-on, fast positive spike on the supply line or software reset command), it is very important to
keep the Vdd line as smooth as possible. Noise or periodic disturbing signal superimposed the supply voltage may prevent the part
getting out from reset state. To avoid this phenomenon use adequate filtering on the power supply line to keep the level of the
disturbing signal below 100mV p-p in the DC – 50kHz range for 200ms from Vdd ramp start.. Typical example when a switch-mode
regulator is used to supply the radio, switching noise may be present on the Vdd line. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations
how to decrease the ripple of the regulator IC and/or how to shift the switching frequency.
